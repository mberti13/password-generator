# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a randomized password generator that will randomize a password at a length specified by the user, as long as it is between 8 and 128 characters. The user is prompted for the use of different types of characters and a password is generated for the user, based on the user's specifications, when the "Generate Password" button is clicked. Through the creation of this projects I broadened my knowledge on JavaScript in order to create the logic that allows the password's to be generated.
